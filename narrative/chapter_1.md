# RPG: Campaign Notes: The Order Of The Stone

## Chapter 1: Terror on The SS Champagne

Chapter 1  begins with the  investigators sent to explore  a seemingly
abandoned ship, the SS Champagne. Finding nothing on  board but chaos
and carnage,  the investigators must  figure out what has  happened to
the passengers and  crew, as well as dealing with  the survivors of an
unspeakable  rite  and  the  hideous monster  that  is  stalking  them
all. Can the investigators escape the  creature? And, if they do, what
can they  glean from  the clues  they find  while aboard  the stricken
ship?

### Clues

The following conditions should be met to ensure they have everything
they need to succeed in this and subsequent chapters. Thus, the
investigators need to find:

  * ***Dr. Sebastian’s diary*** (Handout: Terror 1), which contains
    information not only about the number of urns in existence and the
    timing of the second ritual, but also about Agran’Talan’Tsoth’s
    resilience against mundane weapons.
  * The ***annotated ship’s passenger manifest***, which identifies
    the Summoners and their leader, Dr. Sebastian (Handout: Terror 2).
  * The ***First Fragment of the Scroll of Xivon*** (Appendix A, page
    137). With this, the investigators should be able to draw a ward
    to either keep the monster at bay or contain it.
  * ***Michelle O’Shannesy***. Ideally, Michelle should survive her
    ordeal on the SS Champagne.

### Handouts

  * Map of SS Champagne
  * Dr. Sebastian’s diary (Handout: Terror 1)
  * The annotated ship’s passenger manifest (Handout: Terror 2)

### Dramatis Personae

  * ***Dr. Abram Bethnell*** , 54, chair of anthropology at Miskatonic
    University. Bethnell is a specialist in the works of Sir James
    Frazer and a huge fan of Margaret Murray’s The Witch-Cult in
    Western Europe. He has worked at Miskatonic University for decades
    and is well liked by his students and fellow department
    members. The loss of contact with the SS Champagne, coupled with
    the accidents at the archaeological dig in Ireland, have convinced
    Dr. Bethnell that something unusual—and quite obviously
    dangerous—is going on. He is determined to see the rest of the dig
    crew safely back in Arkham, unaware that this is an impossibility.
      * Description: a portly white man with receding, unkempt white
        hair and pince-nez. Usually dressed in a suit, collar, and bow
        tie. Has a slightly wild look in his eyes.
      * Traits: tends to get carried away in hyperbolic fantasies;
        under the current circumstances they’re fantasies of
        catastrophe. Unfortunately, this time, his fears are proven
        correct.
      * Roleplaying hooks: as someone who studies folklore, mythology,
        and the occult, Bethnell has no problem working with
        investigators that are known to dabble in such
        things. However, he has no inkling of the Mythos’
        existence. By their reputation, he knows the investigators are
        his best hope of finding out what has happened to the SS
        Champagne, so he does everything he can to enlist their aid
  * ***Thomas Moorehouse*** , 43, harbormaster of Greyport. Raised
    among dockworkers, Moorehouse worked his way up to a management
    position in the Harbormaster’s Office, where he’s been for 20
    years. He initially suspected that the SS Champagne’s problems
    were down to a faulty radio or some other electrical issue, but
    now he’s not so sure. Moorehouseis certain that once they get on
    board, they will find everyone huddled below decks waiting for
    rescue. He couldn’t be more wrong.
  * ***Bernarda “Bernie” Greene*** , 41, captain of the fishing boat
    Foggy Sea. Captain Bernie is gruff and quiet, with decades of
    sea-going experience. Unless the players find some other way to
    get onto the SS Champagne, she is the trawler captain who ends up
    taking them to the drifting ship aboard her boat, the FV Foggy
    Sea—either because Dr. Bethnell hires her to do so, or because
    Thomas Moorehouse sends the investigators to her. And if she and
    her crew are going to get dragged into any rescue attempts, Bernie
    wants to launch and get going before the storm gets any worse, not
    stand around talking about it!
      * Description: a solidly built Mexican American woman, with skin
        like leather and short graying hair. She looks like a woman
        twenty years her elder.
      * Traits: determined and stubborn; doesn’t talk much and prefers
        to keep to herself. When she does speak, it is often in grunts
        and growls. Bernie has no problem giving commands to those
        around her whether she’s in charge of them or not.
      * Roleplaying hooks: Capt. Bernie is motivated mostly by money
        but has compassion for those on board the SS Champagne. While
        she would prefer not to risk her own people, she knows deep
        down that if she were in trouble, she would want other
        captains to come to her aid. It’s up to the investigators
        whether to make the trip worth her while financially or to
        play on her worry for the other ship’s crew and passengers if
        attempting to convince her to help.
  * ***Michelle O’Shannesy*** 32, Order of the Stone leader. Michelle
    was born to a wealthy Irish family and joined the Order of the
    Stone as a teenager when a friend recommended her. The promise of
    membership in an elite, clandestine group entranced her, and she
    quickly took to the Order’s secret ways. Over time, like most
    members, she was lulled into the false sense that most of the
    Order’s traditions were nothing more than ancient
    superstitions. Still, she stayed with the society, mostly to stave
    off boredom. When the urns were discovered, she was as shocked as
    the rest of the Order, though still not entirely convinced of he
    danger that might be unleashed. She watched from the sidelines as
    attempt after attempt to stop the dig failed. Finally, she signed
    up to lead the crew heading to America on the SS Champagne to
    prove to herself and her closest friends that there was nothing to
    worry about and that the Order’s elders were overreacting. In
    light of recent events Michelle now knows just how right the
    elders were.
      * Description: a petite white Irish woman, dressed in a
        hodgepodge of clothes scavenged to replace the ones covered in
        her friends’ blood. Michelle has a very nervous expression and
        always seems to be resisting glancing over her shoulder to see
        what’s behind her. Her bobbed red hair is held back untidily
        with a scarf.
      * Traits: Michelle is incredibly jumpy and quick to run off to
        hide if scared. She is clearly terrified of the monster and
        refuses to talk about it, other than to say it has killed
        everyone.
      * Roleplaying hooks: Michelle’s goal is to get off the ship
        alive so she can warn the other members of the Order about
        what’s coming. She does not reveal her background with the
        Order, instead insisting that she is a socialite from
        Dublin. This is true—just not the whole truth. Michelle tells
        anyone who wants to confront Agran just how insane that idea
        is and refuses to participate in such foolishness, physically
        fighting anybody who tries to force her to take part. If
        caught in a confrontation, she uses the knife she found in one
        of the kitchens and flees as soon as she can. Once the
        investigators learn about the ward, Michelle reluctantly backs
        any plan that involves it, because she knows it should work—as
        long as no one interferes.

### Start 3: Old Salts

> Today started like most other days for you, the crew of the fishing
> vessel Foggy Sea, a trawler working out of Boston Harbor. You were
> preparing to go out fishing despite the less-than-ideal weather
> conditions, when Thomas Moorehouse, the harbormaster, came on board
> and asked to speak to Captain Bernarda “Bernie” Greene and the rest of
> the crew.
>
> “I’m sure you’ve noticed that the weather is beginning to turn out
> there. I know you want to get out and catch your fill before you need
> to take shelter from the storm, but I’ve come to ask for your
> help. We’ve had sightings of a ship, the SS Champagne, drifting with
> no signs of life. If that ship has no crew when that storm hits, she
> will likely run aground—or worse.”
> 
> He stops and scratches several days’ worth of beard growth, a
> concerned look on his face. With a long sigh, he continues, “There are
> hundreds of passengers and crew on that ship, and we’ve not had a
> single response from her on the radio. I need a crew I can trust to go
> out, lash up to her side, and board her. We need to find out what’s
> happened, and make sure she's not lost in the rough seas that are
> coming.
> 
> “You and your crew have done solid work for me when I’ve needed you in
> the past. I’ll pay each of you $100 for the day’s work, as I know it’s
> dangerous.”

### In Deep Water

* One way or another, the investigators should now be aboard the FV
  Foggy Sea, steaming toward the last known location of the SS
  Champagne.

> The seas within Boston Harbor were rough enough, but now that you’ve
> broken away from the bay’s protection, the swells have grown
> larger. Each wave seems to rise that bit higher than the last one, and
> the effect is stomach churning for even the most experienced sailor.

* Each player should make a **CON** roll; investigators failing the
  roll are seasick and suffer a penalty die on all rolls until they
  are aboard the SS Champagne
* Once the fishing trawler reaches the open sea, the investigators
  endure another two hours of stomach-churning rough seas before they
  finally catch sight of the SS Champagne.

> Finally, the FV Foggy Sea crests a large wave, and you get
> your first good glimpse of the SS Champagne. The ship itself is
> large, with eight decks, and is close to 800 feet (244 m) in length.
> 
> Scanning the decks, you see that all 16 lifeboats are present. Most
> are still lashed in place on the boat deck, although a few seem to
> have been partially lowered, their covers whipping in the wind.
> Half the ropes securing one lifeboat have snapped or come undone,
> and the boat dangles toward the water, banging forlornly against
> the ship’s side, a splintering ruin. Apart from the deserted air, the
> SS Champagne looks safe enough from here.
> 
> Circling the larger vessel shows no visible signs of damage, nor does
> it indicate any sign of life. The battered remains of a smaller
> vessel, lashed to one side of the ship, must be those of the Harbor’s
> Pride. It has clearly taken on water and would have sunk if not
> fastened to the larger vessel. As the waves smash against it, it slams
> into the liner and continues to break apart at the seams. Soon, the
> Harbor’s Pride will be nothing but driftwood.

* A **Pilot (Boat)** roll is required to see if the FV Foggy Sea can
  safely get close to the stricken liner and lash itself to her side
  in the mounting seas. Although several of the crewmembers have this
  skill, Capt. Bernie is at the helm and responsible for piloting her
  ship unless she is incapacitated. 
  * Success: the FV Foggy Sea safely draws alongside the SS Champagne
    and is securely lashed in place.
  * Failure: the fishing vessel has a minor collision with the larger
    vessel before she is lashed 
  * Fumble or a failed pushed roll: the FV Foggy Sea has a major
    collision with the liner before she is tied in place 
* Collision with the SS Champagne
  * Minor collision: everyone on board the FV Foggy Sea must make a
    **DEX** roll; if failed, they suffer 1D2 damage from being thrown
    around.
  * Major collision: the FV Foggy Sea is damaged. Everyone on
    board must make a **DEX** roll; if failed, they suffer 1D4 damage from
    being thrown violently around. A fumble or failed pushed roll sends
    someone Falling Into the Ocean.
* Falling Into the Ocean<a name="falling_into_ocean"></a>: ayone
  falling into the sea at this point should make a **Swim** roll:
  * Success: the character makes it back
    to safety, soaked but unscathed.
  * Failure: the rough seas dash them against the side of the ship,
    inflicting 1D4 damage. If still conscious, the character is able
    to climb back onto the FV Foggy Sea, though they may need some
    assistance from those on board.
* Once the FV Foggy Sea has lashed itself to the side of the larger
  vessel, the investigators need to climb aboard. Capt.  Bernie
  recommends heading for the shelter deck as the easiest one to reach
  from their current position.
* The Keeper should ask what gear the investigators are taking with
  them from the FV Foggy Sea. While the fishing trawler’s contents are
  not catalogued, the Keeper should grant all reasonable equipment
  requests, e.g., lanterns, rope, knives, and so on.

### Aboard The SS Champagne 

#### Spot Hidden Table

| 1D8 Result  | Found Item  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1           | A fire axe. (1D8 + 2 + DB damage) |
| 2           | A box of 10 shotgun shells.         |
| 3           | A wooden board with nails in it. (1D8 + DB damage) |
| 4           | A child's doll, missing one arm and spattered in blood. |
| 5           | A shotgun. (4D6/2D6/1D6 damage) |
| 6           | A large bloody cleaver. (1D8 damage) |
| 7           | A pistol with three shots remaining. (1D8 damage) |
| 8           | A sliver handled hairbrush, worth $20. |

#### What to do with the SS Champagne

* Drop the anchor: if the investigators wish to drop the ship’s
  anchor, they must make their way to the forward service bay on the
  promenade deck and manually release the massive lump of metal into
  the water. Normally, this operation requires several crewmembers,
  but a single investigator could release the anchor with enough
  time and a successful **Pilot (Boat)** or **Operate Heavy
  Machinery** roll
* Restore power to the ship: to get the engine started again, at
  least one of the boilers must be returned to operational
  status. This is a very involved task that takes at least three
  investigators half an hour and a successful **Mechanical Repair**
  roll to achieve. If there are fewer investigators available or
  they are distracted by either Agran or Cade Thompson, the process
  instead takes at least one hour
* Guiding the ship to safety/deeper waters: Once power is restored,
  an investigator on the bridge can attempt to steer the vessel out
  of danger. Due to the storm, this is no easy task and requires a
  Hard **Pilot (Boat)** roll:
  * Success: the investigator guides the ship far enough into deeper
    waters to make it safe for several more hours. This takes an
    hour, during which time Agran or Cade Thompson could make an
    appearance on the bridge.
  * Failure: the waves continue to push the vessel toward the shore.
  * Fumble or a failed pushed roll: the ship hits the rocks around
    the harbor and starts taking on water (see Sinking the SS Champagne)

* Clues: N/A
* Events:
  * Crossing to the SS Champagne
    * Players to roll **Climb**
	  * Success: the investigator clambers safely aboard the
	    liner. They may now assist the next person to get on board,
	    granting that person a bonus die on their **Climb** roll.
	  * Failure: the investigator is unable to make any progress—the
        ladder is too wet to get a good purchase on, the vessels are
        moving too much, etc. The investigator can either spend **Luck**
        to alter the result (see Using Luck, page 10), or they can
        describe what they are doing to push the roll.
      * Fumble or a failed pushed roll: the investigator falls due to
        the rough seas and a difficult climb. They must make a **Luck**
        roll: if successful, they land in the FV Foggy Sea, suffering
        1D4 damage unless they also make a successful **Jump** roll
        (halves damage to 1D2); a failure means they tumble into the
        rough waves, see [Falling into the Ocean](#falling_into_ocean).

> 
> Then you see a blood spatter across one of the deck’s walls. There
> is no indication of where it came from. A short distance away you
> find another gruesome spatter, then another. A railing with a bloody
> handprint, a small pool of congealed blood—whatever happened here,
> it was dreadful.

* Description: The investigators come aboard the SS Champagne on its
  shelter deck. Both sides of the deck have promenades running most of
  the way from the ship’s bow to its stern, save for a small section
  at the bow (accessible only by the ship’s crew). The sections
  between the promenades contain several third- class and maintenance
  areas, as well as rooms with balconies overlooking the first-class
  and second-class dining areas. There is also a section containing
  second-class cabins.

* Description: The promenade deck is the second deck from the top of
  the ship and contains first- and second-class cabins and amenities,
  with a large open deck area in the bow. Spacious promenades run the
  majority of the deck’s length, reserved mostly for first-class
  passengers.
